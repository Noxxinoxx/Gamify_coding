# Gamify Coding

Overview
---------
Gamify Coding is a project designed to help you stay motivated while coding by transforming your coding journey into a game. Track your progress, compete with yourself, and improve your programming skills, all while having fun!

The Story Behind Gamify Coding
-------------------------------
Gamify Coding was born out of a personal struggle with motivation. As the creator (Nox) realized that coding was sometimes challenging and lacked excitement, they turned to video games for inspiration. In most games, you earn points, gain ranks, and experience a sense of achievement. Why not apply the same concept to coding?

This project aims to provide the same thrill of accomplishment, with rewards for progress and challenges for those moments when you need a little extra motivation to keep going.

Features
--------

1. Process Tracker and Categorizer
   Gamify Coding tracks the processes running on your machine and categorizes them as "good" or "bad." 

   - Good Processes: IDEs (like VSCode, Neovim), terminal, coding-related tools.
   - Bad Processes: Video games, social media, and other distractions.

   The app continuously monitors your system, and if a bad process is running, it negatively impacts your progress. However, good processes will boost your coding score.

   Example:
   - Running VSCode or Terminal counts as "good" and increases your score.
   - Running CS2 (Counter-Strike 2) counts as "bad" and decreases your score.

2. Tracking Coding Time
   Set daily or weekly coding goals, and track how much time you spend coding versus getting distracted by bad processes.

   - Coding Goals: Set goals like "Code for 2 hours today" or "Program for 10 hours this week."
   - Streaks: Achieve streaks for consecutive days of coding, and earn rewards for consistency.
   - Bonus for Focused Time: Track uninterrupted coding sessions and reward yourself for long, focused work periods.

3. Leaderboard and Rankings
   A competitive element allows users to see how they compare with others.

   - Personal Dashboard: Track your points, progress, streaks, and goals.
   - Global Leaderboard: View the leaderboard and see how you rank against other users based on points or hours spent coding.

4. Notifications and Reminders
   Gamify Coding helps you stay focused with timely notifications and reminders.

   - Distraction Alerts: If a bad process is detected, you'll receive a reminder to get back on track and continue coding.
   - Positive Reinforcement: Celebrate your successes with messages like, "Great job! You've coded for 2 hours today!"

5. Gamification and Rewards
   To make the experience even more fun, Gamify Coding introduces a points and rewards system:

   - XP System: Earn experience points (XP) for every good coding session and lose XP for bad processes.
   - Rewards Shop: Spend your XP on rewards like custom dashboard themes, motivational quotes, and more.
   - Badges: Earn badges for achieving milestones like coding for 7 consecutive days or avoiding bad processes for a week.

6. Collaboration and Challenges
   Gamify Coding also offers a social and competitive aspect:

   - Group Goals: Create or join groups and set collective coding challenges. Collaborate with friends or colleagues to reach coding milestones together.
   - Daily/Weekly Coding Challenges: Participate in challenges where users can compete in solving coding tasks or meeting programming goals.

7. Integration with Coding Tools
   The app integrates with popular coding tools and platforms to track your progress more effectively:

   - GitHub Integration: Sync your GitHub commits and reward yourself with points for every commit.
   - IDE Plugins: Install plugins for VSCode, Neovim, and other popular IDEs to track coding time directly from your editor.

8. Analytics and Reports
   Gain insights into your coding habits with powerful analytics and reports.

   - Performance Reports: Track how much time you spend coding vs. being distracted. Use these reports to identify areas where you can improve.
   - Growth Tracking: Monitor your progress over time. See improvements in your coding time, consistency, and productivity.
