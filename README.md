 # Gamify Coding
_Gamify Coding is a small project designed to help you stay motivated while coding._

Welcome to the README of Gamify Coding! This project is meant for anyone who wants to make coding fun again or struggles with motivation when programming.

The story behind this project is simple. I (Nox) felt like I lacked the proper motivation to code in my free time, even though I had plenty of time to play video games. So, I sat down and came to the conclusion that I enjoy video games because of the prestige, the thrill of winning, and the satisfaction of improving.

Most games I played had a system where winning earned you points, and the more points you had, the higher your rank. This made me realize that I needed something similar for my programming skillsâ€”something that would encourage me to code more and keep learning.

Even though coding can be challenging and tedious, it is an essential part of my daily life. The better I become at it, the better I will perform. But to stay on track, I needed some kind of "carrot" to motivate myself toward success. That is the idea behind this project.
